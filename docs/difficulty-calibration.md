# Difficulty calibration lessons (from Alex's Kepler tasks, Oct-Nov 2026)

## What makes official xhigh fail
- Official xhigh fails on rare coverage slips spread over many independent layers, not on hard modelling.
  pump-wear-assessment: about 10 layers went 8 of 8 officially; about 13 layers went 7 of 8.
- Layers that only the data reveal (records disagree, and only the data settle which is right) slip more often
  than documented corrections. Aim for 13-15 independent layers, several of them data-only.
- Heavy modelling alone does not open the effort gap. Identifying and simulating a lightly damped two-mode
  suspension (screen-fatigue) was done by low effort and xhigh alike.
- superheater-tube-life passed every stage: records-only, about 12 layers, several data-only (thermocouple offsets
  visible only as a ratio step against a neighbour, a silent drift, swapped tags, a tube thinner than the
  register). Local probes: low 1/3, xhigh 2/2. Official: all green, with one difficulty trial failing.
- Local xhigh probes (Claude subagents at xhigh) are stronger than official runs. A local 3/3 has shipped and
  still passed the official difficulty screen.

## What did not work
- Rotor field balancing (three designs): low effort solved it every time. Influence-coefficient balancing is
  linear algebra on documented conventions.
- A one-shot measurement budget whose gaps are flagged plainly in the log is found by low effort. Hiding a gap
  behind a correctable-looking fault traps xhigh more than low.
- The service-plus-budget skeleton (a fieldwork command, ten units, a JSON damage file) failed similarity against
  screen-fatigue. Don't reuse it.
- Clean steps get found: a fault that shows as a clean step against peers, or in a single balance, is found by low
  effort. Opus low runs header balances, peer ratios and step searches unprompted.
- Procedure lines can hint. "Hours whose inputs are unknown are left out", combined with a repaired fault, invites
  the solver to use only the post-repair window.
- Noise-driven difficulty: an agent hugging a single lab reading with no stated repeatability fails on unlucky
  draws. That is a knife-edge, and reviewers dislike it. State the repeatability, then ship a seed on which a
  bore placed only 1 sd inside a limit fails (impeller-shrink-fits).

## What opened the effort gap
- Several faults projecting onto one diagnostic (cooling-tower: three faults all sit in the
  header-minus-risers residual).
- A test budget smaller than the number of things needing measurement, with one escape hidden in a record
  (impeller-shrink-fits: four materials need data above 100 C, 3 tests, and a mill value in one certificate).
- A dated change in the log that makes an earlier survey or certificate stop applying.
- A one-column detail in a table (a spin-test speed differing for one row), or an instrument calibration error
  given in an inspection report.

## Fairness
- Zero-flow windows must be unambiguous. Show a zero error where zero flow is certain (blind flange, pump trip).
- Correct methods can be fragile too. Check method_spread before keeping a layer: every sound method must pass on
  the shipped seed and on nearly all of the 20 laboratory seeds.
- Quality review wants:
  - the solution text to match the code exactly;
  - a structurally independent second implementation;
  - the nearest trap at 1.5x the bound or more;
  - a difficulty explanation that says who does the work;
  - the load-bearing document named by absolute path in the instruction;
  - no narration.
