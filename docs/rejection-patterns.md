# Rejection patterns and validation failures

## Team lead's list (Oct 18, 2026): the most common reasons tasks are rejected
1. **Tolerance inside the noise of correct methods.** The reference may even fail its own gate on some seeds.
2. **Accuracy bars the solver cannot see.** A tolerance or threshold that is stated nowhere.
3. **Unstated conventions decide the score.** Index bases, centring, boundary placement.
4. **Shipped data that is wrong without a warning.**
5. **Shortcuts that skip the science.** Noise columns that give back the noiseless signal, shipped fits.
6. **Results that don't separate good attempts from bad.** Every trial lands on the same answer, or the only
   failures are tiny overshoots.
7. **Puzzles, answer files, spec transcription, or recovering planted constants from a synthetic record.**
8. **Not a scientific result.** Schedules, staffing or cost plans don't count.

## Design rules we take from this
- Set the tolerance from the spread of all sound methods; a method is unsound only if it is wrong in the truth.
- Keep a wide gap (aim for 2x) between the worst sound method and the nearest unsound one.
- Difficulty must come from structure (evidence to go and get), never from tightening the band.
- Every source the solver might trust and the grader does not must be signalled as unreliable in the documents.

## Similarity rejections
- wafer-chill-control (Oct 4): too similar to wafer-chill-recipe.
- shrink-fit-hubs (Nov 9): too similar to flange-torque-spec. The overlap was joints J01-Jnn, friction measured
  on a budgeted rig, a maintenance log and one number per joint in JSON. Reworked as impeller-shrink-fits:
  a different subject, a CSV deliverable with two quantities per part, and a dilatometer lab.
- Rule: each new task must differ from the whole catalogue (docs/catalogue.md) in subject AND in deliverable
  shape and verification.

## Validation failures, Nov 9 (impeller-shrink-fits 20261109b)
**Blocking:**
- **Security:** preflight.py held the programme names base64-encoded for a banned-name scan and exempted the task
  name. That counts as obfuscation and self-check evasion. Rules: no base64, rot13 or encoded strings anywhere in
  a bundle, and no programme-name scan in preflight.
- **Verification explanation:** verifier_checks.py hard-coded an old reference sheet, so its output showed the
  valid variants as UNEXPECTED while the README claimed they were accepted. Rules:
  - build every verifier-check case from the current reference at run time;
  - make preflight fail if verifier_checks.txt contains UNEXPECTED;
  - rerun every evidence script after any change.

**Advisory (open):**
- task.name should use the benchmark's required prefix rather than "afterquery/"; ask Alex for the exact
  string.
- category/subcategory and the three explanation fields may belong only in README.md, not task.toml.
